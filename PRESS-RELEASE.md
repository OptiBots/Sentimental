There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  'Sentimental' (working name) is a site where you can interact with visual displays of 'sentiment analysis' data, exposing how various news sources are biased for or against particular public figures.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  If you are an inquisitive newsreader who wants to think critically about how news outlets and popular blogs shape pubic opinion, come to 'Sentimental' for a stark display of where you get your news from.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

   'Sentimental' gives the average newsreader the power to question authority through data-driven displays of media bias. We live in an age of information saturation, where opinions are everywhere but facts are hard to tease out. Every informed newsreader has a vague understanding that each news source has some bias - one paper is more liberal by reputation, while another is held to be more conservative - but we don't have a detailed, historical picture of this slant. For example, the average newsreader doesn't have insight into the specific inflection points of media opinion: when did a given music blog begin to pan your favorite band, or when exactly did the New York Times decided to favor a particular candidate? By tapping the latest methodologies of sentiment analysis, 'Sentimental' allows you, the average citizen, to query vast stores of news data and see what stance each outlet has taken.


## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
 
  People need the power to test their intuitions about media bias against concrete data.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Through advanced sentiment analysis and customized visual displays, 'Sentimental' lets you tell a data-driven story about how the sources you read either worship or discard the public figures of the day.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "We made 'Sentimental' to help average people keep an eye on powerful media organizations both old and new. We hope it will help users make more informed choices about their information diet. We've created a few examples of what 'Sentimental' can do, but really 'Sentimental' is what our users make it. This is in line with the mission of our previous media endeavors, such as Tony Talks."
  - Tony Johnson, full-stack engineer and podcast coordinator.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  Come to 'sentimentaldev.azurewebsites.com' and browse through some of our examples of data-backed media bias trends. When you've gotten a sense of the power of 'Sentimental' graphical displays, you can enter search terms and create your own picture.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "'Sentimental' brings such data-driven nuance to a phenomenon we have only been able to observe in the most qualitative terms. I am shocked at what I have learned by browsing this site. You won't believe what happened when the Wall Street Journal changed its slant towards Justin Bieber."
  - Kalev Roomann-Kuric, famous tech blogger

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Wake up, sheeple! The time for ineffectual whining about media bias is past. The power to expose the puppetmasters of public opinion now lies in your hands.
